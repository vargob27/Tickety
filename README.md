# Tickety

#### Tickety is a ticket manager application built for small teams but able to be scaled up. Each user will create an account which allows them to display their top 3 skills. This allows for optimal selection when assigning a ticket to a user. Tickets are displayed in order by due date. Completed tickets are archived Profile pages show what tickets are assigned and what tickets were created by that user.
